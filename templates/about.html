<h5> Intellectual property sales</h5>

{#<--! START HERE: Flesh out rationale for choosing the seven countries. Complete analysis of eurostat numbers. -->#}

<p>
Global economic data shows an explosive growth rate of 5435.6% from 1975-2016 for patents, copyrights, and trademarks
, collectively, intellectual property (IP). World Bank data shows "charges for the use of intellectual property, receipts", or IP sales,
grew from $5.9B USD in 1975 to $326.6B USD in 2016. Compared with other economic indicators, IP sales presents
an interesting bellwether for understanding how countries across the world innovate, develop, design, and engineer new
ideas&mdash;<i>as well as license and sell branding, design, and creativity in the arts.</i>  This web application uses
the <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-api-documentation">World Bank API</a>&nbsp;
to draw comparisons between IP and other economic indicators to show IP as a contributor to overall growth.
</p>

<p>
DataPanino provides you with data visualizations, a tool for insight into IP sales in context of other economic
indicators. I want to give analysts a tool to see relevant data in the context of economic growth. It's that simple.
DataPanino allows you to see IP along with three major economic indicators:
</p>

<li> IP, &nbsp;Intellectual Property Sales </li>
<li> GNI, &nbsp;Gross National Income </li>
<li> GDP, &nbsp;Gross Domestic Product </li>
<li> FDI, &nbsp;Foreign Direct Investment</li>
{#  Define EUTM  #}
&nbsp;
<p>
DataPanino's target audience is analysts, economists, and investors. But of course, anyone can use it.
</p>
<h5> Background</h5>

<p>
Why choose these seven European countries? In the same period, 1975-2016, the European Union (EU) saw an increase from $1.4B USD to $124B USD.
That's a 8757% increase. While other countries around the world show higher figures of IP sales, the European Union has
become highly competitive with other global leaders like the United States, China, and India.

<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Intellectual_property_rights_statistics&stable=0#Context">
Eurostat</a> states: "Based on the number of trademark applications made in 1996-2015, the
leading European countries in terms of EUTM protection are Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland."
</p>
{#  Define COMMUNITY DESIGN #}
{#   http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do  #}
<p>
For IP, or "community designs filed," from 2006 to 2016, the same 7 countries hold the highest
average in the European Union, with one exception. (For that same period, Poland averaged 2611
community designs filed whereas Switzerland averaged 2227 and the Netherlands averaged 2193.)

However, I chose these seven countries based on two criteria: European Union trade mark and IP sales (EUTM and IP).
Therefore, I selected Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland were selected because
they ranked highest in both criteria combined.

<h5> Why DataPanino? </h5>

<p>
'Stacked' bar charts look like tall sandwiches. "Panino" in Italian, means "sandwich." Our
name, "DataPanino," makes data quickly "digestible" in context of other indicators. Hence, the name.
If our charts make you hungry, I recommend patronizing your favorite neighborhood restaurant for lunch.
I understand that staring at charts can be boring. That's why a unique model, a data delicatessen,
provides you with a way to build your own "data sandwich."  You can save, or serve, your views as part of
your research if you like. I recommend that you save custom views to your profile.
